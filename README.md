# Budibase Plugins
Below are the Budibase plugins I have created!

## Budibase File Upload Tool
https://github.com/chungchunwang/Budibase-File-Upload
This component is used for adding file fields inside of forms. It stores data inside a text value (JSON serialized), so it sould work with any text-based database column. This should work with both the Budibase DB and any other external SQL or noSQL DBs as all the files are fully serialized into text. This is useful if you wish to circumvent the default attachment field of Budibase, which stores data in MiniIO, and you instead want to store data directly inside your database. As files can have a lot of data within them, do note that some of the generated text fields can be quite long.

## Budibase File Repeater Tool
https://github.com/chungchunwang/Budibase-File-Repeater
This is a companion to the Budibase File Upload Plugin, and is used for displaying the file data stored by the File Upload Plugin on non-form pages. Just pass in the string generated by the File Upload Plugin and it will act as a repeater, repeating child components for every file and providing a URL link to the file through context. Note that the URL lengths can be very long as they carry the file information itself.

## QR Code Scanner
https://github.com/chungchunwang/Budibase-QR-Code-Scanner
A component that scans QR codes.
